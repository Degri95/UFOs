# UFOs
Creating a webpage with a dynamic table and filter for UFO sightings using Javascript and D3.

## Overview
In this project javascript was used to create a filter function that allowed users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. The webpage only had a filter for date so more filter inputs were added via HTML. After assigning unique ID's to each of the input elements the code was able to be refactored to store our inputs into a variable and and filter our data by the selected filters.
